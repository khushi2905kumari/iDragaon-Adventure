- Basically in this game , one dyno and one dragon are there in one line. and dragon will be continuesly moving on that straight line so basically you need to move Dyno Up-Down-Forward-Backward accordingly so that it not crash with dragon.

- These is a score board which will be showing your score after each cross 

- Once you get crashed with dragon, the game will be over. and your final score will be displayed.
